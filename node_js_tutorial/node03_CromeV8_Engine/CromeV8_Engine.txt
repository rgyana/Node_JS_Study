Crome's V8 Engine & Node.js
- Crome's V8 engine by google sits at the core of Node.js
- By embedding V8 into your own c++ application, you can write c++ code that gets executed when a user writes JavaScript code.
- You can add new features to JavaScript itself.
- Since c++ is greater for lower level operation like file handling, database connections and network opeations, by embedding V8 into your own c++ pragram, you have the power to add all of that fucntionlity in JavaScript.
- The c++ program we are talking about is Node.js
