What is ECMAScript ?
- In 1993, the first web browser with a user interface called Mosaic was released.
- In 1994, the lead developers og Mosaic founded a company called Netscape and released a more polished bowrser called Netscape Navigator.
- Web pages coudl only be static and there was no interactivity after a page was loaded.
- In 1995, Netscape created a new scripting language called JavaScript.
- The name was purely for marketing purpose as Java was the hot new language back then.

The Advent to Microsoft
- In 1995, Microsoft debuted their browser internet Explorer
- Microsoft realised that JavaScript fundamentally changed the user experience of the web and wanted the same for internet explorer.
- But there was no specification for them to follow.
- In 1996, Microsoft reverse-engineered the Naviagator interpreter to create its own scripting language called JScript.
- The difference made it difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both browser.
- Best viewed in Netscape adn Best viewed in Internet Explorer badeges became common.

ECMA International
- In nov 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScriptti ECMA International.
- It is an industry association dedicated to the standardization of infromation and communication systems.
- Netscape wanted a standard specification that all browser vender could conform to as it would help keep other implementations consistent across browsers.
- For each new specification ECMA provides a standard specification and a committee.
- In case of JavaScript, the standard is called ECMA-262 and the committee that works on ECMA-262 is called Technical committee 39(TC39).
- ECMA however decided to use the term "ECMAScript" to tald about the offical language.
- The reason fo this is because oracle (who acquired Microsystem) owns the trademark fo the term "JavaScript".
- ECMAScript refers to the standard language whereas JavaScript is what we use in practice and builds on the top of ECMAScript.
